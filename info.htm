<h4>Getting started</h4>
<p>Structure your content in folders. The rule is - one folder contains one web page.<br>
You can name the folders with space and national characters. eg: "Mötley Crüe"<br>
</p>

<h4>Edit "index_vars.js" file</h4>
<p>The file "index_vars.js" in each folder contains variables that are read by "index.htm to load page content. 
Open "index_vars.js" in each folder and modify the variable values for your page name.</p>
<p>  
<code>VARS.name = "Page title"; (Page name, also used as H1 tag in "index.htm")<br>
    VARS.data = "page-readme"; (Data ID, that can be used as page identifier)<br>
    VARS.category = "Help"; (Category, for any purpose)<br>
    VARS.file_name = "readme.htm"; (file name with html text that is read by index.htm)<br>
   </code> 
</p> 
<p>  
You can edit file "pages.htm" for pages/sub folder to show and made viewable.
