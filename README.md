The worlds most popular HTML editor with more than 100 million users.

I was searching the web for a good HTML editor for local PC use, but couldn't find one. So I ended up making a HTML Page Editor with TinyMCE, the worlds most popular HTML editor, used on more than 100 million websites. But the project became much more - a full CMS. POW CMS is now a unique and minimalistic, full featured HTML Editor and Web Site builder "application" with more features under development. Start to build your Portable Offline Web Site today.
