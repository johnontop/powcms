<h4 style="margin-top: -5px; margin-bottom: 3px;">The worlds most popular HTML editor with more than 100 million users.</h4>
<p>I was searching the web for a good HTML editor for local PC use, but couldn't find one. So I ended up making a HTML Page Editor with <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a>, the worlds most popular HTML editor, used on more than 100 million websites. But the project became much more - a full CMS. POW CMS is now a unique and minimalistic, full featured HTML Editor and Web Site builder "application" with more features under <a href="sysinfo/development/">development</a>.
